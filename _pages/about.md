I am a pre-doctoral master student at the University of Chicago, advised by Prof. [Junchen Jiang](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~junchenj/). My recent research focuses on video streaming and video analytics.

Before coming to UChicago, I obtained my bachelor's degree at Peking University. As an undergraduate student, I worked extensively on vehicular wireless networks with Prof. Lingyang Song.

I am actively looking for a Ph.D. position in the area of computer systems and networking and their intersection with machine learning.
